This project also runs on Windows (for now), but you need scapy installed. 
```
python -m pip install scapy
```

And also [npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) needs to be installed. 

To start interacting with the SpoofToolCLI, you need to run this in terminal:

```
python SpoofToolCLI.py
```

To see all commands, type ```help``` once the CLI is running.
Typing ```<command> -h``` shows the usage of the command.
