This project also runs on Windows (for now), but you need scapy installed. 
```
python -m pip install scapy
```

And also [npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) needs to be installed. 

To start interacting with the SpoofToolCLI, you need to run this in terminal:

```
python SpoofToolCLI.py
```

The the individual commands (which you can see if you use "help" command) can be used with arguments.
